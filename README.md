# Portfolio Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Material-UI, and Biome.js

This portfolio template provides a minimal setup to get started with building a web application using React, TypeScript, Vite, Material-UI, and Biome.js. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast development iteration.

## Acknowledgments

- **Biome.js**:: https://biome.sh/

## Folder Structure

- `src/`
  - `layout/`: Contains layout components used to structure the overall UI of the application.
  - `routes/`: Defines the routing configuration of the application.
  - `hooks/`: Contains custom React hooks used throughout the application.
  - `app/`: Contains the main application component or entry point.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable UI components used across different pages or features.
  - `locales/`: Contains localization files for internationalization and localization (i18n).
  - `pages/`: Contains the main page components or views of the application.

### Additional Details

- **Layout**: The `layout/` directory typically includes components that define the structure of the application's UI, such as header, footer, sidebar, etc.
- **Routes**: The `routes/` directory includes configuration related to routing, such as defining routes using React Router or another routing library.
- **Hooks**: The `hooks/` directory contains custom hooks used to encapsulate logic that can be reused across different components.
- **Components**: The `components/` directory houses reusable UI components that are used multiple times throughout the application.
- **Locales**: The `locales/` directory includes localization files for supporting multiple languages and translations within the application.
- **Pages**: The `pages/` directory contains the main page components or views of the application, organized by different routes or sections of the app.
